Basically BioJS components behave like Lego blocks. You don't start from scratch - can build on top of other blocks.

What exactly is a BioJS package?
-------------------------

A __tiny building block__ that can be reused by anyone.
It could be anything from a FASTA parser, a tree algorithm or a simple visualization module.  

What is BioJS?
---------------------

We are quite more than just a registry for components - we aim to build a infrastructure 
, guidelines and tools to avoid the reinvention of the wheel in life sciences (= "Docker for Bio web components").
In the early days of BioJS we defined specific _Easy to_ goals, let's see where we currently stand:

* Easy to combine - `require('my-awesome-biojs-component')`
* Easy to use - `npm install my-awesome-biojs-component`
* Easy to develop: we make only minimal rules and try to give the developers as much freedom as possible
* Easy to discover: BioJS components can be easily browsed at [biojs.io](http://biojs.io)
* Easy to understand: We hope you like this education platform
* Easy to maintain: Everyone creates a github repo for this component and maintains only the code he loves
* Easy to get involved: Apart from our amazing tutorial, we are also very active on github and gitter
